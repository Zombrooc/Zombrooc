# Hello, my name is Elian Valdez (Zombrooc) 👋


## 🚀 About me

23 years old and a programming student since I was 15, I started learning Python but ended up also studying other languages like Java, PHP and Ruby. Today I found myself in JavaScript and its technologies (Next.JS, Nodej.JS, etc.), a practical, performative language that is widely used today to build the most varied solutions, whether on the Web, Mobile or even the Back-end.

Currently I work as a Designer but I keep studying the programming universe and doing freelancing using the technologies I studied for so long.
